# Our Mission: Breaking Operating System Barriers

At the core of our project lies a fundamental conviction: **software must be universal**. We firmly believe that the choice of an operating system should not dictate which applications you can use or what experiences you can enjoy.

Our mission is to empower the community of Linux and open platforms users, facilitating access to their favorite applications and tools through a simplified technical infrastructure. We are not just developing a launcher; we are building a technological bridge designed to eliminate the friction between complex software and the end user.

## Our Strategic Pillars

To achieve this vision, we work on three fundamental axes:

### Universal Accessibility
We work to make installing and running software on Linux a transparent experience. We want any user, regardless of their technical knowledge, to access entertainment and creativity tools without facing tedious configurations or library incompatibilities.

### Removing Limits
We strive to ensure that the operating system is a foundation of freedom, not a cage. Our goal is for creativity and entertainment to flow without interruptions, ensuring that the most demanding tools work with the performance that the hardware allows, without layers of unnecessary complexity.

### Fostering an "Open-First" Ecosystem
By expanding the use of applications on Linux, we not only help the user but also strengthen the free software ecosystem. We want to demonstrate that Linux is a first-class platform for gaming, design, and development, attracting more creators and users to this environment.

## Our Promise

We work so that, in the near future, the question *"Does this work on my system?"* ceases to exist. We are dedicated to perfecting **Trinity** and **Hytale Launcher** as examples of technical excellence, where the power of Linux meets the simplicity that the modern user demands.
