Welcome to **Trinity Projects**, an open-source ecosystem dedicated to breaking down barriers between operating systems and end-users. We build tools that make Linux accessibility a reality for gamers and creators alike.

## Who We Are

Trinity Projects is a community-driven initiative focused on creating high-quality, user-friendly software for the Linux ecosystem. We believe that powerful technology doesn't have to be complicated. Our team consists of passionate developers, designers, and open-source enthusiasts working together to improve the Linux desktop experience.

## What We Do

We develop intuitive launchers and tools that simplify complex tasks.

## Why "Trinity"?

The name represents the three core pillars of our philosophy:
1.  **Performance:** Software that respects your hardware.
