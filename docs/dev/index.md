# Development: Overview

Welcome to the development ecosystem of our Launchers. This space is designed to centralize the knowledge, tools, and standards needed to build the next generation of community tools.

## The Project

Currently, our development is divided into two main pillars:

* **Trinity Launcher:** Our base engine and instance management platform for Minecraft Bedrock.
* **Hytale Launcher:** The specific and custom implementation for the Hytale ecosystem (Coming Soon).

## Architecture and Philosophy

We aim to create modular, fast, and secure software. Our architecture is based on the separation of concerns: the **Core** manages heavy processes, while the **UI** offers a fluid and modern user experience.

### Tech Stack

To maintain consistency across projects, we use:

* **Core:** C++ (Qt6 Framework)
* **Frontend:** Qt Widgets
* **Communication:** REST APIs / C++ Signals & Slots
