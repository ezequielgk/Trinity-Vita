# Launchers Overview

Trinity Launcher isn't just a single application; it is a **community-driven hub** designed to unify modern gaming experiences on Linux. 

Our goal is to act as a bridge between complex open-source projects and the end-user, providing a "one-click" solution for games that don't always offer native Linux support.

### Key Projects we support:
* **Minecraft Bedrock:** Powered by the community-led efforts of the `mcpelauncher` and `msa` projects.
* **Hytale (Upcoming):** Preparing the ground for the next generation of sandbox RPGs with native-like performance.

By using **Flatpak technology**, we ensure that these projects remain isolated from your core system, providing a safe and stable environment for every player.
