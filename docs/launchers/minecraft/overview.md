# Minecraft Bedrock: Overview

Trinity Launcher provides a native-like experience for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** on Linux. Instead of using heavy emulators, our solution leverages community projects that translate Android system calls into Linux-native instructions.

### A Community Effort
This implementation is made possible thanks to the collaboration of several open-source initiatives:
* **mcpelauncher-manifest:** Keeps the game versions updated and accessible.
* **msa:** Handles the secure authentication with Microsoft accounts.

By integrating these projects, Trinity Launcher offers a seamless experience with support for Xbox Live, multiplayer, and high-resolution textures.
