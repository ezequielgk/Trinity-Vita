## What is Trinity Launcher?

Trinity Launcher is more than just a tool; it is a **community-driven open source solution** designed to bring the Minecraft Bedrock Edition experience to the Linux ecosystem natively and efficiently.

### Built by the Community, for the Community

Unlike monolithic launchers, Trinity is a bridge between several ambitious open source projects. Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where developers and players work together to maintain compatibility and performance on Linux.

* **Powered by Collaboration:** Trinity leverages the incredible work of the **mcpelauncher-manifest** and **msa** projects, ensuring that the integration with Microsoft services and game updates remains seamless.
* **Open & Transparent:** Developed under the **BSD License**, our codebase is fully transparent. We encourage users to contribute, whether through code, translations, or bug reporting.
* **Standardized Distribution:** By utilizing **Flatpak technology**, we ensure that the community’s efforts result in a secure, isolated, and consistent experience across any Linux distribution, from Ubuntu to Arch.

> **Join the Project:** Trinity is a living ecosystem. Every improvement you see is the result of community feedback and the shared goal of keeping Bedrock Edition accessible to everyone on the open-source desktop.
