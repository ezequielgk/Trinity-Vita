# Welcome to Trinity

Trinity is an ambitious open source ecosystem designed to bring the **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** experience to the Linux desktop. It bridges the gap between different open source projects to provide a seamless, performant, and native-feeling experience.

## The Ecosystem

Trinity is composed of several core projects, each serving a specific purpose in the architecture:

### 🚀 Trinity Launcher
The user-facing application that manages your Game, Instances, and Accounts.
- **Native Experience:** Built with Qt6 to feel at home on your Linux desktop.
- **Sandboxed:** Distributed via Flatpak for security and stability.
- **Open Source:** Completely transparent and community-driven.

### 🎮 Hytale Launcher (Coming Soon)
Future support for Hytale, integrating seamlessly into the Trinity ecosystem.
- **Coming Soon:** Currently in planning/development phase.
